# Internship at BSUIR
### Application type 
Web application (more than just a website).
### For what/whom?
This app is for kids and their parents. 

>The idea is in the joint development and entertainment of parents and children. Parents from all over the world create, invent or remake fairy tales/audio fairy tales. You can record a fairy tale with your voice and after approval by the administrator, the fairy tale will be uploaded to the network and either only your child or children from all over the world will be able to hear it. And the opportunity to write a fairy tale from scratch is both entertainment for parents and entertainment for their children in the future. Didn't like the ending of your favorite fairy tale? You can rewrite an existing fairy tale as much as you like.
